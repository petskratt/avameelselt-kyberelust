Hi!
 
We got the invoice from SOME CHINA INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS CO LTD for the amount of 1477 USD. (see attached)
 
I’ve added the amount of 1477 USD and our sub-trade bank account details to the original PI – please see it attached.
 
Kindly note  that our accounting department  informed us  that the bank account has been placed on hold by our bank ,this is due to excessive inflow of payment,you are been advised to make payment to our sub-trade bank account details.
 
 
I hope all is OK now and you can go ahead with the payment.
 
Kind regards,

Marko
